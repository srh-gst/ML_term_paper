@article{Barrero.2020,
 abstract = {Drawing on firm-level expectations at a one-year forecast horizon in the Survey of Business Uncertainty (SBU), we construct novel, forward-looking reallocation measures for jobs and sales. These measures rise sharply after February 2020, reaching rates in April that are 2.4 (3.9) times the pre-COVID average for jobs (sales). We also draw on special questions in the April SBU to quantify the near-term impact of the COVID-19 shock on business staffing. We find 3 new hires for every 10 layoffs caused by the shock and estimate that 42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss. Our survey evidence aligns well with anecdotal evidence of large pandemic-induced demand increases at some firms, with contemporaneous evidence on gross business formation, and with a sharp pandemic-induced rise in equity return dispersion across firms. After developing the evidence, we consider implications of our evidence for the economic outlook and for policy responses to the pandemic. Unemployment benefit levels that exceed worker earnings, policies that subsidize employee retention, occupational licensing restrictions, and regulatory barriers to business formation will impede reallocation responses to the COVID-19 shock.},

@article{Chen.2010,
 abstract = {e-Learning systems are increasingly being adopted by modern enterprises, because of their cost-down effect. However, the extant literature provides little insight into their beneficial consequences. It is expected that a transfer of acquired knowledge, skills and/or work attitudes to jobs will occur through e-learning systems use. This makes e-learning systems a useful tool for improving job outcomes, although this is not well documented. The IS success model, which captures both the human and technological elements of information systems, provides a theoretical basis for linking system use to system task. The current study then examines the relation between e-learning systems use and overall job outcomes based on the model. The data collected from one hundred and ninety-three e-learning system users were analyzed with partial least square (PLS). The results indicate that e-learning systems are perceived as useful and satisfying by employees, and employees' e-learning systems use is significantly associated with overall job outcomes. In practice, these results provide a basis for establishing a link between an organization's investment in e-learning and human capital management. They also lend empirical support to the IS success model.},

@article{Kennedy.,
 abstract = {While MOOCs have taken the world by storm, questions remain about their pedagogical value and high rates of attrition. In this paper we argue that MOOCs which have open entry and open curriculum structures, place pressure on learners to not only have the requisite knowledge and skills to complete the course, but also the skills to traverse the course in adaptive ways that lead to success. The empirical study presented in the paper investigated the degree to which students' prior knowledge and skills, and their engagement with the MOOC as measured through learning analytics, predict end-of-MOOC performance. The findings indicate that prior knowledge is the most significant predictor of MOOC success followed by students' ability to revise and revisit their previous work.},

Learners who enrol in massive open online courses (MOOCs) have different backgrounds and tend to have different motivations than learners in traditional courses. Based on value--expectancy theory, an instrument was developed to measure motivation for enrolling in a programming MOOC. A study with 1229 adult participants in Estonian--language programming course ``About Programming'' was conducted to validate the instrument. Results of confirmatory factor analysis validated the 7--factor scale named factors influencing enrolment in MOOC (FIEM). FIEM comprises three factors of expectancies, three factors of values and one factor of social influence. The highest and lowest rated motivational factors influencing enrolment in programming MOOC are discussed in the paper. Interest in and expectations for the course, personal suitability of distance learning and suitability for family and work are the highest--rated motivational factors for those who enrol in MOOC. Usefulness related to own children, social influence and usefulness to related to certification were the lowest rated. The results of this study can be useful for designers of programming MOOCs and the developed scale might be used in future studies.},

Social distancing, self-isolation and travel restrictions have lead to a reduced workforce across all economic sectors and caused many jobs to be lost. Schools have closed down, and the need for commodities and manufactured products has decreased. In contrast, the need for medical supplies has significantly increased. The food sector is also facing increased demand due to panic-buying and stockpiling of food products. In response to this global outbreak, we summarise the socio-economic effects of COVID-19 on individual aspects of the world economy.},

Therefore, this research objective is to explore the MOOC's features, particularly, to identify the difference platform of edX and Coursera. Those platforms have the most significant number of learners; in learner's perspectives through the Resource Activity Support Evaluation (RASE) pedagogical method and learning activity components, which consists of Absorb, Do, Connect activity. The study conducted at a private university in Indonesia with 60 students as respondents and they were also involved in experiments activity to use MOOC's platform. This study used quantitative approach to identify the difference platform between edX and Coursera. The significant results from this study can open mind the researcher to understand the uniqueness of MOOC's platform particularly in edX and Coursera, and it also can be considered as a starting finding toward advanced research in education technology area for the higher education institution.},

To find out the student's attitude towards e-learning, primary data has been collected from national and international wise through Google forms which include the student community from various schools, colleges, and universities. This research paper aims to study the E-learning process among students who are familiar with web-based technology. It also helps to find out solutions to improve the self-study skills of students. The stratified sampling method has been adopted in this study and the sample size is 175 across the world. The findings of the study reflect the impact of E-learning, students' interest in using E-learning resources, and their performance. In conclusion, this study shows that E-learning has become quite popular among the students all over the world particularly, the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic.},
