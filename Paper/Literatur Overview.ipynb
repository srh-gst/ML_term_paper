    "we compute abstract, routine and manual task measures that are found to be well-validated visa-vis previous research. Second, we estimate task prices, and find that a one-standard-deviation increase in abstract tasks is related to a 3.3-log-point wage premium, whereas there is a 2.6 to 2.9-log-point wage penalty for each standard deviation of routine (manual) tasks. Development factors and labour market institutions, particularly union coverage and strictness of employment protection legislation, seem to play a role in the differences in all three task prices.\n",

These findings encourage the use of workplace-level data rather than occupational-based data to measure job contents/tasks...\n",

    "### The Impact of training on productivity and wages: firm level evidence - Konings (2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical foundations of on-the-job training have originally been formalized by Becker (1964) who made a distinction between general and spefic training. Under perfect competition, firms will not pay for general training of their workers as they can leave the firm searching for better paid work, which compensates them for the increased productivity acquired through general training. Hence, the worker is the sole recipient of general training benefits and will also bear the costs of it. Yet, in a series of papers Acemoglu and Pischke (1998, 1999a, 1999b) argue that a substantial amount of training is paid for by firms and is still general in nature. They show that a necessary condition for firms to pay for general training is a compressed wage structure, caused by imperfections in the labor market such as monopsony. With a compressed wage structure, training increases the marginal product of labor more than the wage, which creates incentives for the firm to invest in general training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that an increase in the share of trained workers by 10 percentage points is associated with 1:7 percent to 3:2 percent higher productivity, depending on the specifcation. However, consistent with the theoretical insights about wage compression and training, this increase in productivity is not entirely offset by a similar increase in wages. The average wage per worker only increases by 1:0 to 1:7 percent in response to the same increase in training.\n",

    "### Skill Mismatch and the Costs of Job Displacement - Nedelkoska 2015\n",
    "\n",
    "We find thatdisplacement increases the probability of occupational switching and skill mismatch,primarily because displaced workers often move to less skill-demanding occupations.Event-study analyses show that these downskilled switchers suffer substantially largerdisplacement costs than occupational stayers. Workers moving to more skill- demanding occupations have similar earning losses as stayers, and do not experience any displacement costs conditional on being employed. \n",

    "### On-the-job-training, job search and job mobility - Zweimüller, Winter-Ebmer (2003)\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper analyzes the impact of firm-specific training on job mobility. While many recent studies have looked at the impact of on-the-job training on level and growth of wages, the impact of training on employee turnover has received far less attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theory of human capital, developed by BECKER (1964), distinguishes general and firm-specific training. By definition, the former is applicable in all firms, whereas the latter is productive only within a particular firm. This distinction has important implications for the financing of training: in its strict form, firms will be reluctant to finance general training, because workers can reap the rewards of training in any firm.2 Likewise, this distinction has also consequences for job mobility. While investments in general training may induce a worker to search more actively for a new job, specific training investments may induce a worker to stay with the current firm. \n",
    "\n",
    "The role of training for labor market turnover is also highly relevant from the point of view of economic policy. With respect to specific training, the threat of termination of the employment relationship may lead to underinvestment. For obvious reasons, it is important to know to which extent specific training reduces job search and actual job separations. In contrast, general training could increase the mobility of the workers and thus enhance the flexibility of the labor market. Hence it is important, and highly policy-relevant, to know the quantitative impact of general training on job search behavior and actual job mobility.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the present paper, we will study the consequences of training for job mobility and job-search. As actual job mobility is the composite of voluntary quits and involuntary layoffs, which are difficult to separate in most cases, we look also at the workers' intention to look for a new job. Workers' on-the-job search activity gives us a separate indicator for mobility intentions on the part of the worker. Furthermore, turnover and intended turnover can be seen as a main determinant in unequal treatment of males and females in terms of wages and/or job promotion.3 Training on the job is certainly one measure to increase the worker's attachment with his firm. We therefore estimate the impact of training separately for males and females.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the few papers that address the issue, LYNCH (1991), GRITZ (1993), and PARENT (1999) find that company training reduces the probability of job separations for young U.S. workers. In contrast, KRUEGER and ROUSE (1998) who focus on personnel files from two large U.S. companies, and VEUM (1997) who uses NLSY-data conclude that trainees are equally likely to quit than\n",
    "non-trainees.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find, in fact, that the predictions of human capital theory are confirmed: workers, who had firm-specific training last year, search less for a new job and quit their jobs less often. The opposite is true for general training, the effect thereof being numerically somewhat larger. Workers who had no quit intention a year ago, the provision of firm-specific training reduced, and that of general training increased, actual quit behavior a year ahead. Effects are less pronounced for the case of workers, who had already quit intentions in the past.\n",
    "In sum, our results clearly indicate that on-the-job firm-specific training provision on the part of the firm can have a substantial impact on quit behavior of the workforce,\n",
    "which might be a cost-effective way to influence detrimentally high worker turnover. General training, on the other hand, might considerably increase the willingness and/or\n",
    "the possibilities on the part of the workers to change their jobs.\n",

    "### The retention effect of training: Portability, visibility, and credibility - Dietz, Zwick 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "o maintain competitiveness, increase productivity and to avoid skilled labour shortages, establishments must invest in the human capital of their employees (Stevens, 1994; Green et al., 2000; Zwick, 2006; Aguinis & Kraiger, 2009). However, to benefit from the new skills and to recoup the investment in training participants, it is important to keep trained employees at the establishment in the long term (Acemoglu & Pischke, 1999). \n",
    "\n",
    "An important condition for the prediction that portable human capital training decreases retention is that there are no labour market frictions. Monopsony theory proposes a number of frictions that explain why training establishments can avoid losing employees with general human capital training (Stevens, 1994; Acemoglu & Pischke, 1999). Important examples of these market frictions are training establishments having better information about the ability of their training participants (Acemoglu & Pischke, 1998; Autor, 2001) or training contents (Katz & Ziderman, 1990; Chang & Wang, 1996). A key hypothesis is that training visibility may be a precondition for the portability of general human capital training (Acemoglu & Pischke, 1999a; 2000; Katz & Ziderman, 1990). In other words, information asymmetries about training contents may transform portable human capital into non-portable human capital (Becker, 1962, p. 50–51; Barron et al., 1997b; Loewenstein & Spletzer, 1999, p. 730; Booth & Bryan, 2005). Thus, focusing on portability may produce wrong conclusions about the retention effect of training in the presence of market frictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why even general human capital training may not lead to a decrease in retention. According to monopsony theories based, for example, on labour market frictions, retention probability also depends on the visibility of training contents (Acemoglu & Pischke, 1999a; Chang & Wang, 1996). The current employer usually has an information advantage concerning the exact content (e.g. focus and type of training) and the amount of training. Training measures are often informal, heterogeneous, and tailored to the needs of the training participants (Katz & Ziderman, 1990), and thus they are hard for outside establishments to assess. Based on this information asymmetry, it is difficult for outside establishments to observe and assess the quantity and quality of training fully. Consequently, outside firms will not be willing to compensate the trained employees fully for their newly acquired skills, and they pay a wage below the real productivity of the trained employees (Acemoglu & Pischke, 1998; 1999; Benson et al., 2004; Katz & Ziderman, 1990). The training establishment with an information advantage should be able to match the outside wage offer for trained employees it would like to retain. Hence, portable training that is hard to assess or invisible may not reduce retention. Loewenstein and Spletzer (1999) and Booth and Bryan (2005) argue but do not show that invisibility may transform portable training into non-portable training. Thus, only visible and portable training may reduce retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are few empirical papers on the retention effects of training. An important reason for the scarcity of papers is that detailed information on training characteristics over a certain period, especially the timing of training and employment spells, is needed (Krueger & Rouse, 1998; Lynch, 1991). Empirical papers draw different conclusions on the retention effect of training and most papers have drawbacks. Many papers have no information on training contents or cover only part of the training activities that may be correlated with other training activities that are not controlled for (Lynch, 1991; Parent, 1999; Veum, 1997; Brunello & De Paola 2009). Many papers only cover a selected group of training participants; for example, employees in entry-level jobs after education or young employees (Lynch, 1991). Papers with detailed information on training contents tend to be case studies (Krueger & Rouse, 1998; Benson et al., 2004; Kampkötter & Marggraf, 2015). Finally, several papers cannot account for selectivity for training because they have cross-section data and no proper instrument for training participation (Dearden et al. 1997; Loewenstein & Spletzer, 1999; Green et al. 2000). Most importantly for our contribution, no empirical paper has assessed the joint impact of portability and training visibility on retention so far. Differences in the measured retention effects of training therefore might be caused by uncontrolled differences in visibility or portability of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that training increases employee retention by up to 14% for all training measures and a stronger retention effect of 18% for credible training, depending on the estimation method. Training visibility and portability reduce retention by up to 2.5% in general and by 4% for credible training, respectively. As a consequence, the overall training retention effect is positive even for portable, visible and credible training. Training firms therefore can enjoy the double dividend of increased productivity and retention after training irrespectively of the training characteristics.\n",

    "### Does spatial employment density spur inter-firm jobswitching?- Martin Andersson Per Thulin 2012\n",
    "\n",
    "There are strong theoretical arguments in favor of that inter-firm labor mobility isa conduit for the productivity advantages of density. Mobility of labor is associatedwith  two  micro-foundations  for  agglomeration  economies:  learning  and  matching(Duranton and Puga 2004). It stimulates learning by being a vehicle for diffusion ofknowledge and ideas (Almeida and Kogut 1999;Agrawal et al. 2006). Knowledge,experiences, and competencies are embodied in people, and movements of employeesbetween firms bring about knowledge diffusion and learning which stimulate fasterknowledge accumulation (cf.Glaeser 1999;Feldman 1999;Glaeser and Maré 2001).Inter-firm job switching of workers is also a means to efficient labor market matchingprocesses. Models of labor markets typically emphasize that the quality of matchesare uncertain ex ante and must be experienced to be evaluated (Farber 1994).Topeland Ward(1992) show that the typical path to a stable employer–employee relationis indeed characterized by frequent job switching. Efficient labor market matchingshould thus be associated with job switching (cf.Finney and Kohlhase 2008). Thesearguments suggest that inter-firm job switching of workers is a mechanism throughwhich learning and matching effects materialize.\n",

    "### The Role of Off-the-Job vs. On-the-Job Training for the Mobility of Women WorkersAuthor(s): Lisa M. Lynch 1991\n",
    "\n",
    " In particular, this paper focuses on the role of different types of training on the probability of leaving an employer. In previ- ous work (1990) I have examined the impact of private-sector training on the determina- tion of wages and wage growth of young workers and reached the following conclu- sions. First, formal company-provided on- the-job training (ON-JT) appears to be highly firm-specific in the United States and, therefore, is not portable from employer to employer. Company-provided training raises wages in the current job but has no effect on the wages earned in subsequent employ- ment. Second, formal off-the-job training (OFF-JT) received from \"for-profit\" propri- etary institutions has little effect on the wages earned on the current job, but it does raise the expected wage in subsequent em- ployment. Finally, there are important dif- ferences by race, gender, and education level in the probability of receiving different types of formal training and in the impact this training has on wages and wage growth.\n",

    "### Hiring Behavior Models for Online Labor Markets - kokkodis et al (conference paper)\n",
    "\n",
    "In an online labor marketplace employers post jobs, receive freelancer applications and make hiring decisions. These hiring decisions are based on the freelancer's observed (e.g., education) and latent (e.g., ability) characteristics. Because of the heterogeneity that appears in the observed characteristics, and the existence of latent ones, identifying and hiring the best possible applicant is a very challenging task. In this work we study and model the employer's hiring behavior. We assume that employers are utility maximizers and make rational decisions by hiring the best possible applicant at hand. Based on this premise, we propose a series of probabilistic models that estimate the hiring probability of each applicant. We train and test our models on more than 600,000 job applications obtained by oDesk.com, and we show evidence that the proposed models outperform currently in-use baselines. To get further insights, we conduct an econometric analysis and observe that the attributes that are strongly correlated with the hiring probability are whether or not the freelancer and the employer have previously worked together, the available information on the freelancer's profile, the countries of the employer and the freelancer and the skillset of the freelancer. Finally, we find that the faster a freelancer applies to an opening, the higher is the probability to get the job.\n",
